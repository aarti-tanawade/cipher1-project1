# Implementation of the Vigenère cipher

This project is a Python implementation of the Vigenère cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages using a keyword-based polyalphabetic substitution.

It demonstrates:
How to apply the Vigenère cipher algorithm programmatically.
Handling of non-alphabet characters in the message.
Use of modular arithmetic to wrap shifts around the alphabet.
